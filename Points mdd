## Updated Step Descriptions

1. **The Model Developer uploads MDD documents via the Minerva UI interface for processing.**[1]

2. **The Minerva UI triggers the MDD Upload Service, which acts as a Kafka producer and generates outbound messages with uploaded document details.**[1]

3. **MIDAS subscribes as a Kafka consumer to the Minerva topic (midas.mdd.checker.requests), receiving outbound messages from the MDD Upload Service to initiate document validation.**[1]

4. **The MDD Checker Service reads each outbound message from Kafka and performs primary validation on the uploaded document.**[1]

5. **Primary validation results and any supporting files are stored in OCP Pod Storage to maintain persistent records and facilitate downstream actions.**[1]

6. **Once validation is complete, the MDD Checker invokes Tachyon’s Gemini API for further document analysis on GCP, and receives synchronous model evaluation results.**[1]

7. **After validation and model analysis, MIDAS sends the check results—such as Excel reports—via email and updates the result queue as needed.**[1]

8. **Processed documents and audit entries are stored in PyFarm’s PostgreSQL database, supporting future weekly performance reporting in Power BI for model validators.**[1]

These refreshed sentences provide a clear, stepwise description of each component’s purpose and the flow of outbound messages across the MDD Checker system[1].
