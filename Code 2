Thank you — now it’s absolutely clear.

Since you cannot read the file directly (due to encoding or YAML formatting issues), and you still want to analyze its contents intelligently in Python, here's the best alternate solution:


---

✅ Option: Paste the File as Raw Text into Python and Let It Parse

You can paste the raw contents (as-is) from your YAML file into a Python multiline string, and we’ll handle everything else from there.


---

✅ Step-by-Step Code (No File Read Needed)

import pandas as pd
import re

# STEP 1: Paste your raw YAML content below
raw_text = """
- python=3.11
- numpy=1.24.3
- pandas=1.5.3
- openai==0.27.8
- langchain==0.1.0
- pytorch_select=2.0=cuda_2
"""

# STEP 2: Split lines and detect source/type intelligently
rows = []
for line in raw_text.strip().splitlines():
    line = line.strip().lstrip("- ").strip()
    if not line:
        continue
    if "==" in line:  # pip-style
        pkg, ver = line.split("==", 1)
        rows.append({"Library": pkg, "Version": ver, "Build": "", "Source": "pip"})
    elif "=" in line:
        parts = line.split("=")
        rows.append({
            "Library": parts[0],
            "Version": parts[1] if len(parts) > 1 else "",
            "Build": parts[2] if len(parts) > 2 else "",
            "Source": "conda"
        })

# STEP 3: Display as DataFrame
df = pd.DataFrame(rows)
df.sort_values("Library").reset_index(drop=True)


---

✅ Result:

You’ll get a clean table like this:

Library	Version	Build	Source

langchain	0.1.0		pip
numpy	1.24.3		conda
openai	0.27.8		pip
pandas	1.5.3		conda
python	3.11		conda
pytorch_select	2.0	cuda_2	conda

Would you like me to help extract and clean from a screenshot or sample content if you can’t paste it directly?
