Get the GPU cluster operational and ready to run LLMs (even without Run:AI) by Friday.


---

ðŸ“… Plan to Achieve the Goal

1. Infrastructure Readiness (Mon-Tue)

[ ] Confirm server setup is complete (on SILO 0.6 or other cluster).

[ ] Validate GPU visibility (nvidia-smi) and driver compatibility.

[ ] Ensure access to namespaces where GPU workloads will run.


2. Environment Setup (Tue-Wed)

[ ] Finalize conda or venv environment with required packages:

PyTorch / Transformers / CUDA / LLM dependencies


[ ] Validate container or notebook image builds (JupyterHub, if needed).

[ ] Test simple GPU script (e.g., torch.cuda.is_available()) to confirm functionality.


3. Harness / CI Pipeline (Wed)

[ ] If using Harness, validate repo onboarding and deployment pipeline (for Jupyter or LLM workload).

[ ] Deploy and test sample notebook or workload via pipeline.


4. Run:AI Optional Setup (Parallel)

[ ] Confirm Run:AI operator status (if installed).

[ ] If not available, skip fractional GPU scheduling, and plan direct pod-level access.


5. LLM Validation (Thu)

[ ] Run a basic LLM test (e.g., HuggingFace model inference) on the cluster.

[ ] Log GPU usage metrics manually (since Run:AI may not be available).

[ ] Validate storage access (NetApp/NAS or S3) if models or data are large.


6. Final Checklist and Report (Fri)

[ ] Document what is working (infra, access, model run).

[ ] Capture what is pending (if any) and what Run:AI will add when integrated.

[ ] Prepare a short demo or log evidence of LLM running on GPU cluster.
