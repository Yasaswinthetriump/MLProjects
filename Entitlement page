Perfect! Before I start writing, I need you to answer the critical questions from my previous message. However, let me prioritize the **most important ones** that will block me from creating accurate documentation:

---

## **🚨 BLOCKING QUESTIONS - Need Answers to Proceed**

### **Priority 1: Resource Type Master (CRITICAL)**
```sql
SELECT resource_type_id, resource_type_name, description 
FROM midasst.resource_type_master 
ORDER BY resource_type_id;
```
**Why critical:** I saw IDs 5 and 7 in your screenshots, but you only mentioned 5 types. I need the complete authoritative list.

---

### **Priority 2: Complete Table Schemas**
```sql
DESCRIBE midasst.product_master;
DESCRIBE midasst.role_master;
DESCRIBE midasst.user_role_assoc;
DESCRIBE midasst.resource_privilege;
DESCRIBE midasst.resource_type_master;
DESCRIBE midasst.system_configs;
```
**Why critical:** Need column names, data types, and constraints for the ERD and query examples.

---

### **Priority 3: Data Transfer Authorization Rules**
**Specific scenario:**
```
User with role_id = 60360 (Commercial)
Wants to create data transfer: PYFARM_HWX_DEV → PYFARM_S3_DEV
```

**Show me the exact rows needed in `resource_privilege`:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM midasst.resource_privilege 
WHERE role_id = 60360 
  AND resource_uri IN ('PYFARM_HWX_DEV', 'PYFARM_S3_DEV');
```

**Or tell me:** 
- What `resource_type_id` grants "data transfer" capability?
- Do I need 2 rows (one for source, one for destination)?
- Do I need different resource_type_ids for read vs write?

---

### **Priority 4: System Configs Structure**
```sql
SELECT * FROM midasst.system_configs 
WHERE system_name LIKE 'PYFARM%' 
LIMIT 5;
```
**Why critical:** Need to understand how systems are registered and referenced in `resource_privilege.resource_uri`.

---

### **Priority 5: AD Integration Details**
- Which AD groups map to which `role_id` values?
- Example: `"WF_DS_Commercial_Team"` → `role_id = ?`
- How often does AD sync run?
- What happens when user's AD group membership changes?

---

## **📊 What I Can Start With (If You Can't Answer Everything Now)**

If you can provide **just the Priority 1-3 answers**, I can create:

### **Phase 1 Documentation (Immediate)**
✅ Architecture overview  
✅ Core table relationships  
✅ Basic access provisioning workflow  
✅ SQL query templates  
✅ Troubleshooting common issues  

### **Phase 2 Documentation (After remaining answers)**
⏳ Complete ERD with all columns  
⏳ AD integration details  
⏳ Environment-specific procedures  
⏳ Advanced troubleshooting  
⏳ Compliance/audit section  

---

## **Quick Decision Point**

**Option A:** You provide all answers now → I create complete documentation in one go  
**Option B:** You provide Priority 1-3 now → I create Phase 1 documentation → You provide remaining answers → I update with Phase 2

**Which approach works better for you?** 

Also, can you run these queries and paste the results? That would be the fastest way:

```sql
-- Query 1: Resource types
SELECT * FROM midasst.resource_type_master ORDER BY resource_type_id;

-- Query 2: Sample resource_privilege for a role
SELECT * FROM midasst.resource_privilege WHERE role_id = 60360 LIMIT 10;

-- Query 3: Sample system_configs
SELECT * FROM midasst.system_configs WHERE system_name LIKE 'PYFARM%' LIMIT 5;

-- Query 4: Table schemas
SHOW COLUMNS FROM midasst.resource_privilege;
SHOW COLUMNS FROM midasst.role_master;
SHOW COLUMNS FROM midasst.user_role_assoc;
```

Once I have these, I'll start building the Confluence page! 🚀
