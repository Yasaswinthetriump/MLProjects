bringing up PI Planning (Program Increment planning, from SAFe / Agile at scale), she’s really talking about how your Elasticsearch onboarding + 
Here’s how you could map it for her in a PI Planning context:

PI Planning View (Q4 — 2 resources)

Objectives

1. Deliver Elasticsearch as a managed capability on OCP (BM25 + vector).


2. Enable GPU-accelerated semantic search pipeline (embedding → ES vector).


3. Provide GitHub Pages onboarding portal for self-serve adoption.


4. Onboard 2–3 pilot teams with secure access, quotas, and dashboards.




---

Features / Capabilities

Core ES cluster (ECK on OCP): TLS, RBAC, namespace, API keys.

Governance: ILM policies, quotas, snapshots + restore.

Observability: Kibana dashboards, alerts to Splunk/Grafana.

GPU pipeline: embedding service on H200 → dense_vector fields in ES.

Documentation: GitHub Pages with Quickstart, governance, vector demo.

Onboarding: sessions, success checklist, feedback loop.



---

Milestones / Iterations

Iteration 1 (Weeks 1–3): Deploy ES + Kibana (DEV/UAT), set up access.

Iteration 2 (Weeks 3–5): Add ILM, quotas, logging/metrics.

Iteration 3 (Weeks 5–7): Snapshots + restore; dashboards + alerts.

Iteration 4 (Weeks 6–10): GPU embedding service, vector search demo.

Iteration 5 (Weeks 10–12): GitHub Pages v1 + onboarding sessions.



---

Risks

Limited headcount (2 resources → must keep scope tight).

GPU contention if other teams oversubscribe.

Vector search can blow up storage → enforce ILM.

PI Planning Talking Point

“In Q4, with 2 resources, we’ll deliver Elasticsearch as a managed platform service with governance, GPU-powered semantic search, and GitHub Pages docs. By end of quarter, 2–3 pilot teams will be onboarded and self-serving.”

👉 This is exactly the kind of one-pager Sindhu can take into PI Planning so leadership sees:

Objectives (why we’re doing it),

Capabilities (what teams will get),

Iteration breakdown (when they’ll see value).

Do you want me to format this into a PI Planning “Objectives + Features + Risks” slide that you can plug directly into your deck?
