Perfect — since your clusters are MAN-41 and LEW-41, here’s the revised Confluence page draft reflecting exactly your environment (Run:AI + OCP + Harness + H200 GPU setup).
You can copy-paste this directly into Confluence — it’s styled for your internal team documentation (Runbook / NFR / Known Issues section).

🧱 Run:AI Limitations – MAN-41 & LEW-41 GPU Clusters

Last Updated: November 2025
Owner: Sri Yasaswini Bokka – Platform AI Engineering
Scope: MAN-41 (Primary GPU Cluster) | LEW-41 (Secondary GPU Cluster)
Platform Stack: OpenShift 4.x | Run:AI v2.21 | NVIDIA H200 GPUs | Harness CI/CD | JupyterHub

🧩 1. Scheduling & GPU Distribution

Limitation	Description	Cluster Impact	Mitigation / Next Steps

Single-Node Confinement	Run:AI cannot automatically distribute one job across multiple GPU nodes without MPI/DDP.	Both clusters — large LLM training restricted to 8 GPUs per node.	Enable distributed training (Pytorch DDP / Horovod).
Fractional GPU Fragmentation	0.25/0.5 GPU allocations leave idle VRAM segments unused.	MAN-41 (Dev) shows lower utilization under multi-user queues.	Encourage full-GPU runs for LLM tests or adjust fair-share policy.
Pod Pending State	Scheduler fails to assign GPU due to taints/tolerations or node pool conflicts.	Common in LEW-41 after node restarts.	Verify labels and tolerations; restart Run:AI scheduler pod if stuck.

⚙️ 2. MIG & Driver Dependencies

Limitation	Description	Cluster Impact	Mitigation

Stale MIG Partitions	MIG instances stay marked “in-use” after pod deletion.	MAN-41 GPU #5 and #6 often require manual reset.	nvidia-smi mig -cgi -C or node reboot before rescheduling.
Version Mismatch Risk	Run:AI Operator ↔ CUDA Driver mismatch after updates.	Affects both clusters during 2.21 upgrade.	Maintain Driver–Operator compatibility matrix; test in LEW-41 first.



---

🗂️ 3. Storage & PVC Lifecycle

Limitation	Description	Impact / Cluster	Mitigation

No Automatic PVC Backup	Run:AI does not retain PVC data for user home dirs or Jupyter pods.	LEW-41 user PVCs lost after namespace cleanup.	Use OpenShift PVC retain policy or NAS snapshot automation.
NAS Mount Mismatch	Path differences (/mnt/data vs /home/jovyan) cause access denied.	Intermittent in MAN-41 Dev.	Standardize Helm templates with /mnt/nas mount.



---

🔐 4. RBAC & Namespace Authorization

Limitation	Description	Impact	Mitigation

RBAC Misalignment	Run:AI roles don’t fully map to OCP RBAC.	“Unauthorized” error on PVC mount between projects.	Create cluster-level role bindings via LDAP groups.
Manual Role Sync	No auto propagation of Run:AI roles to OCP.	Manual update needed when users added to projects.	Schedule weekly RBAC sync job via Harness.



---

📊 5. Monitoring & Dashboard Visibility

Limitation	Description	Observed Cluster	Mitigation

Metrics Delay (10-30 s)	GPU utilization and job status refresh delayed in UI.	Both clusters.	Integrate Prometheus / Grafana for real-time metrics.
Pod-Scoped Logging Only	Multi-pod training logs not aggregated under one job.	MAN-41.	Centralize logs with Fluentd or ELK stack.



---

🧰 6. CI/CD Integration Gaps

Limitation	Description	Impact	Mitigation

Harness Trigger Limitation	Run:AI CLI not natively supported in Harness pipeline.	Manual job trigger required.	Use REST API wrapper in Harness step.
Jupyter Idle GPU Consumption	Notebooks stay active after user logout.	Unused GPU locked in MAN-41.	Deploy idle-pod cleanup cron job.



---

🧩 7. Version & Operational Notes

Maintain Run:AI ↔ CUDA ↔ OCP version compatibility sheet.

Upgrade first in LEW-41 (test bed) before MAN-41 (prod).

Document idle GPU clean-up and PVC backup flows in Runbook.

Sindhu’s escalation (Oct 2025): lack of VRAM visibility → added VRAM Calculator proposal in Runbook.



---

✅ Summary / Action Plan

1. Enable real-time GPU metrics integration.


2. Automate RBAC role sync between Run:AI and OpenShift.


3. Add PVC snapshot policy in LEW-41 by Q4 2025.


4. Test multi-node distributed training in LEW-41 before enabling in MAN-41.

Would you like me to generate this as a formatted Confluence export (Markdown → HTML) so you can paste it with headings, tables, and emojis preserved?
Or should I add a “Known Issues” sub-section for Sindhu’s VRAM and Pod Pending escalations too?
