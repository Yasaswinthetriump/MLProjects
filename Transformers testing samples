Certainly, Shindu! Here's a ready-to-use Bokeh visualization notebook cell that works with a Hugging Face Transformers Q&A pipeline, version 5.9+ compatible, and clean for direct use in your Jupyter Notebook on JupyterHub. This shows the answer score visually using Bokeh bar chart.

✅ Step-by-Step Notebook Cell (Clean, Paste-Ready)

# Step 1: Install Bokeh (if not installed)
!pip install bokeh --quiet

# Step 2: Import libraries
from transformers import pipeline
from bokeh.plotting import figure, show, output_notebook
from bokeh.models import ColumnDataSource

# Step 3: Prepare output for inline display
output_notebook()

# Step 4: Load Q&A model
qa_pipeline = pipeline("question-answering", model="distilbert-base-uncased", device=-1)

# Step 5: Context and question
context = """
Transformers are a type of deep learning model used for tasks like text classification, Q&A, and summarization.
They use self-attention mechanisms to understand relationships in sequential data.
"""

questions = [
    "What are transformers used for?",
    "What mechanism do transformers use?"
]

# Step 6: Run Q&A
results = []
for question in questions:
    result = qa_pipeline(question=question, context=context)
    results.append({"question": question, "answer": result['answer'], "score": result['score']})

# Step 7: Prepare data for Bokeh
questions_text = [r["question"] for r in results]
scores = [r["score"] for r in results]

source = ColumnDataSource(data=dict(questions=questions_text, scores=scores))

# Step 8: Create Bokeh bar chart
p = figure(x_range=questions_text, height=300, title="Answer Confidence Scores",
           toolbar_location=None, tools="")

p.vbar(x='questions', top='scores', width=0.6, source=source)
p.y_range.start = 0
p.xaxis.axis_label = "Questions"
p.yaxis.axis_label = "Confidence Score"
p.xaxis.major_label_orientation = 1

# Step 9: Show plot
show(p)

✅ What This Does:

Uses Hugging Face Transformers for Q&A

Renders a Bokeh bar chart of confidence scores

Runs entirely on CPU

Requires only transformers and bokeh

Let me know if you want:

To include user input widgets

To display answers on hover

Or store results into a CSV or database


Happy charting!
