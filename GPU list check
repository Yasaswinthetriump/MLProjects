GPU Validation & Project Setup Checklist (OCP AI - Project: mrmcd-jupyterhub)


---

✅ STEP 1: OCP Namespace & Access Setup

[ ] Namespace created in OpenShift: mrmcd-jupyterhub

[ ] Admin access granted to platform admin (initial setup)

[ ] Accessor roles assigned:

[ ] Admin: Infra team lead

[ ] Lead Developer: Access to YAML, Terminal, Metrics

[ ] Users: JupyterHub pod access



✅ STEP 2: Pod & Resource Validation

[ ] Jupyter pod up and running: jupyter-adithya-20chennavaram

[ ] CPU requested vs limit verified:

[ ] 2 cores requested

[ ] 4 cores total limit


[ ] Memory request vs usage observed (e.g., 50 GiB monitored)

[ ] Filesystem and network activity monitored


✅ STEP 3: GPU Validation

[ ] nvidia-smi runs inside pod (GPU detected)

[ ] Required drivers and CUDA toolkit installed

[ ] TensorFlow / PyTorch detects GPU

[ ] Run sample workload for GPU test (matrix mult or ResNet)


✅ STEP 4: Monitoring Tools

[ ] Metrics tab working in OCP dashboard

[ ] Container CPU, memory, file system usage graphs are visible

[ ] Logs accessible via Logs tab for real-time debugging


✅ STEP 5: Storage Validation

[ ] Check if pod uses S3 (NetApp) or PVC

[ ] PVC/S3 correctly mounted and data accessible

[ ] Test data read/write to mounted storage


✅ STEP 6: Development & Deployment Pipeline
