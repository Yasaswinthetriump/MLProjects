Subject: Kafka Message Contract for MDD Checker

Hi Om,

Thanks for your note. To make sure we’re aligned, here is the Kafka message contract we are planning to use for the MDD Checker integration.

Topic Details

Topic Name: mnrv.inventory.modelchecker

Consumer Group ID: mnrv-model-checker-CG1


Message Schema (JSON):

{
  "request_id": "string (UUID, unique per submission)",
  "correlation_id": "string (UUID, used for tracing across systems)",
  "uploaded_by": "string (user email or service id)",
  "uploaded_date": "ISO8601 timestamp",
  "document_name": "string",
  "document_size": "integer (bytes)",
  "document_filetype": "string (docx, pdf, etc.)",
  "submitted_at": "ISO8601 timestamp"
}

Notes

The above schema extends the fields you already share in the Minerva email template (uploadedBy, uploadedDate, documentName, documentSize, documentFiletype).

request_id and correlation_id are included for traceability so requests can be linked to downstream validation results and audit logs.

Validation results will be provided via NAS + email as agreed, not through a separate Kafka result topic at this stage.


Please review and let me know if you would like any adjustments (field names, additional metadata, or formatting changes). Once we agree, I can also put this into Confluence so it’s documented formally.

Thanks,
Sri
