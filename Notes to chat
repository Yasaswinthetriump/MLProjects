Here’s a clean 4-point update (Bono style) you can use:

1. Successfully completed review – Conducted design review with Minerva and confirmed alignment across both teams.


2. Demoed working prototype – Showed the end-to-end flow of MDD Checker from Kafka request through validation and Postgres storage.


3. Finalized architecture – Agreed on one inbound Kafka topic, Postgres (24h TTL) for input/output JSON, audit metadata retention, and MIDAS-owned email/API notifications.


4. Next steps – Minerva to share final payload schema & email template; MIDAS to implement purge job, Results API, and token caching for Gemini integration.



Do you want me to also create a short “leadership slide” version of these four points (very high-level, one line each) for Sadaf?
